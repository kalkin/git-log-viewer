# History

Old history and notes.

The interesting property of tig(1) is that it internally uses git. This means
all it log outputs are customizable.

### Issues

- Depends on not adapted yet (2018) version of prompt_toolkit@v2
- The git log iteration and recognition algorithm needs to be reworked
- prompt_toolkit@v2 has no List widget. Currently we use a `TextArea`. It is a
  hazzle to adopt it

## 2018-09-15

Because we use prompt_toolkit@v2.0 this breaks all other applications depending
on prompt_toolkit who have not migrated yet to v2.0. My biggest issue is
pgcli(1). As of current date pgcli(1) is still
[migrating](https://github.com/dbcli/pgcli/pull/930)

## 2018-08-25

The current version uses prompt_toolkitâ€™s `TextArea` widget to just dump the
commit log as a bunch of text lines. All manipulation for folding are done via
inserting lines in to a huge string.

## Early History

After a few tries I finally ended up with the Python programming language.
Currently (2018-08-25) python hits the sweet point because it provides a good
wrapper around libgit2 (pygit2), a good terminal library prompt_toolkit and is a
dependency brought in by many operating systems.

The first draft used urwid library and the extension library urwidtrees. Sadly
git data structures fit poorly for the default `TreeWidget`s.

The second current (2018-08-25) version uses the new prompt_toolkit 2.0 library
