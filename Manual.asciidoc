== Name

== Synopsis

[verse]
_______________________________________________________________________
*glv* [-w DIR | --workdir=DIR] [REVISION] [-d | --debug] \[[--] <path>...]
*glv* --version
_______________________________________________________________________

== Description

An alternative to man:tig[1]/man:lazygit[1] which supports folding the merges and is
expandable via plugins. The application can resolve the default merge titles
done by using GitHub or Bitbucket to the actual pull request names.

Use kbd:[CTRL+C] or kbd:[q] to exit the application.

== Options
REVISION::
    A branch, tag or commit [default: HEAD]
-w DIR::
--workdir=DIR::
    Directory where the git repository is
-d::
--debug::
    Enable sending debugging output to man:journalctl[1] (`+journalctl --user -f+`)

== Configuration

The Git Log Viewer user configuration file is loaded in the following way. If
`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is set, read user configuration from
`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/glv/config`. If `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is empty or undefined, read
user configuration from `~/.config/glv/config`.

The configuration file consists of sections and variables. A section begins with
the name of the section in square brackets and continues until the next section
begins. Section names are case-insensitive. Only alphanumeric characters, - and
. are allowed in section names. Each variable must belong to some section, which
means that there must be a section header before the first setting of a
variable.

=== Variables

*history.icon_set* (string)::
    The set of icons to use for the icon column. Currently only the following
    are supported:
    - +ascii+
